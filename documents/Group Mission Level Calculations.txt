Max Mission level = 90
Max Group Size = 20

Max Player Value in group = 4.5

250 skillpoints / 4.5 = 55.55

So the player achieves 1 point of group value per every 55 skillpoints spent.

So Mission level is calculated like this.

Total Players Group Value = mission level + random Value Added 0 to Total Group Players


1 Player at master = 4.5
