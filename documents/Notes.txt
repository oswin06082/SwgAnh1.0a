For far in the future:

Bounty hunting waypoints will be generated to be "in the vicinity of" the mark, be it an NPC or a Jedi.

At a tracking effectiveness of 0, the waypoint generated by the seeker droid will be within 256m of the target (or the target's structure)
At a tracking effectiveness of 125 (assumes skill tapes), the waypoint will be within 128m of the target.
At a tracking effectiveness of 100, the waypoint will be within 148m of the target.

Each point of effectiveness moves the waypoint closer to the actual target's location by 1.02 metres, approximately.
