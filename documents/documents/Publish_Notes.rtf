\pard\sb100\sa100\lang4105\b\f1\fs24 Jedi Revamp Part 1: \b0 Publish 9 brings us The Secrets of the Force. In The Secrets of the Force, \b existing\b0  Jedi may now re-allocate their skill points based on the type of Jedi they would like to create. When you log on, you will see a window pop up that will prompt you to convert your Jedi to the new Jedi skill system.\line\line In the new Jedi skill system, you may remain PvE (with the exception of the occasional Bounty Hunters wanting to prove themselves) or may choose to go on to the new PvP Force Ranking System (FRS). Jedi must choose their path to Force mastery by following the path of light or turn to the dark side. The FRS is a PvP mechanic that allows a Jedi to advance beyond the rank of Knight. It consists of two skills trees, one for Light and one for Dark. Each skill represents a Force Rank. Experience to attain these Force Rank skills is gained and lost through PvP actions. Light Jedi will vote on advancement and Dark Jedi will fight for advancement. To advance, the Light Jedi and Dark Jedi have gathered into groups and have set up their own secret Enclaves, hidden away from the Empire, allowing only a set number of players to advance into the various Force ranks. Only a set number of players may attain a given rank within each Enclave. Therefore, in order for one to advance, another must be demoted. Jedi who enter the FRS are automatically set as always overt for their aligned faction (Rebel for Light and Imperial for Dark). As long as they stay within the FRS, they can not go covert or resign/change factions.\line\line Please visit our Jedi Conversion Guide for further details.\line Jedi Conversion Guide\line\line\b Hero of Tatooine: \b0 Due to high player demand, we have revamped and reintroduced the famed ?Hero of Tatooine? quest. The quest utilizes brand new static and dynamic content. Find the hero and see if you have what it takes to acquire the Marks of Altruism, Intellect, Courage, and Honor. For players who previously completed the quest, you will retain your badges and may complete the quests from where you left off or from the beginning. To start the quest, the player must first seek out and speak with the Hermit of Tatooine?\line\line\b Loot Kits:\b0 Loot kits are a new mini-game for collectors. Players can collect a new type of loot from NPC?s and combine them to make better items. Players can start by visiting Junk Dealers to request a ?loot kit. These loot kits are containers that will be used to collect miscellaneous items dropped from NPC?s and can be turned into a new reward for players to keep or sell back to the Junk Dealer.\line\line\b Update Notes List Items\b0\line\line\b Art\b0  Fix some occasional issues with per-pixel lighting where the light would appear to be coming from the wrong direction Fixed Mandalorian helmet so that it is wearable by Rodians Fixed problem with Squill death animations causing them to flip over after death Fixed problem with Grand Healer's robe causing hole in Mon Calamari neck Fixed problem causing too much transparency on Wookiee skirt fur Removed leak in particle emitters that caused some clients whereby particles would build up and lower frame rate while the particle system was alive. (e.g. flamethrower effect) Wookiee Armor now correctly displays the base fur in uncovered areas Fixed potential graphical glitch with Corellian corvette walls related to some new video drivers Sun no longer produces glare inside structures Fix for water on Radeon 8500-class cards\line\line\b Badges\b0  Character badges are now located on a tab on the character sheet instead of the examine window The Character Sheet now displays a list of badges earned by the player and also badges not yet won\line\line\b Bazaar / Vendor\b0  Made improvements to the commodities server response time Fixed problem that could cause invalid bids take money from your account Fixed a problem where you receive an email saying you've been outbid even if you bid on an auction in which you are already the highest bidder Improved auto retrieval code for vendors Players will now be notified when placing an auction bid that is invalid because there is a another bid with a higher value Fixed a problem with MyBids not updating correctly Fixed an issue where vendor registration would not correctly re-register until the server restarted The detail description should now appear on all new items being put on the Commodities Market.\line\line\b Client Stability Enhancements\b0  Fixed two memory leaks including one that would occur each time a rider dismounts from a mount or vehicle without storing it\line\line\b Combat\b0  Improved combat visuals and head tracking in combat. ?Head tracking? for melee combat is now disabled. This addresses problems with head tracking in many of the complex melee combat animations. Notice that the neck no longer snaps around in an unnatural way when executing the move. Adjusted several combat special moves to no longer bypass Toughness defenses Healing commands are now visible in the combat queue. Changed to hit calculations: ?????Defenders can no longer get into a state where they are impossible to hit. There will always be a chance to hit a target. ?????Additionally. Attackers can no longer get into a state where they never miss. There will always be a chance to miss a target. ?????Note: this change effects both Player and NPC alike.\line\line\b Crafting\b0  Weapon/Droid Crafting tools have been fixed and will not work with every single draft schematic in the game. "Generic" items that are not handled by any other specific crafting tool such as a can still be crafted and experimented on with a Weapon/Droid Crafting tool. Made the "misc" crafting type display correctly when selecting a schematic Lightsabers can no longer be crafted with a Weapon/Droid Crafting tool and now require the Lightsaber Crafting tool Lightsabers can now be experimented on when using a Lightsaber tool next to a Weapon/Droid Crafting Station\line\line\b GCW\b0  Fixed several fire rate problems with manual turrets.\line\line\b Grouping\b0  Fixed problem with the group UI not correctly displaying the group member name under certain situations\line\line\b GUI / Keyboard\b0  Removed 5 loading checkboxes from initial loading screen FPS display now correctly goes up to 30 fps (not 29) Fixed problem with the GUI not updating XP totals when XP is gained or lost Can put Vehicle and Pet objects in toolbar to call/store vehicles and pets Added options in the chat options menu to filter out chat from /afk players Jedi will no longer have to reset their special Force UI?s every time they zone or log Toolbar now adds default commands for brand new characters. Command Queue now displays some non-combat commands as appropriate. Attribute Mod window can now shrink vertically to only one row. Items that are reduced to 0 hitpoints, show up as red in your inventory (unless it is equipped in which case it still shows up as an equipped item) Fixed several typos in Command Browser Window. Fixed a typo in the master BE skills window tooltip description Datapad no longer continually offers you help Removed Crash bug involving giving the /alarmremove command an invalid index Macro Editing Window - Removed crash bug, improved UI consistency\line\line\b Holocron / Knowledge Base\b0  Added Holocron entries for the Force Rankings under "Professions" Fixed several typos in the several sections of the Holocron.\line\line\b Inventory\b0  Equipping/un-equipping/transferring items now goes through the Command Queue. Equipping armor and weapons also has a delay associated with it. This is to prevent combat system exploits that were occurring. Traps, Grenades and Heavy Weapons in nested containers will now function correctly\line\line\b NPC?s \b0 Fixed typos in NPC conversations: Bestine Political Quests, Corellia Heralds, Corellia Static Quests, Corellian Corvette, Dantooine Static Quests, Dathomir Static Quests, Imperial Theme Park, Jabba's Theme Park, Junk Dealers, Loading Screens, Rebel Theme Park Quests, Talus Static Quests, Tatooine Heralds, Tatooine Static Quests, Yavin IV Static Quests AI improvements: on steep hillsides and cliffs, creature aggressiveness and accuracy has been improved\line\line\b Other\b0  Fixed problem where free trial users could not deposit money into their bank account if they were near the 50k limit\line\line\b Pets\b0  Removed vitality loss from PvP deaths Added "Incapacitation Recovery" option for pets. This will allow the pet's master to revive an incapacitated pet to 1 HAM point.\line\line\b Profession: Bounty Hunter\b0  Fixed crash to desktop when taking a bounty hunter mission and traveling Temporarily reduced BH - Jedi Bounty Mission rewards (Credits & XP)\line\line\b Profession: Combat Medic\b0  Fixed an issue with Combat Medics swimming and combat actions\line\line\b Profession: Doctor / Medic \b0 If the player attempts to heal an illegal target with /healDamage, the command will default to the player even if the target is not a combat target.\line\line\b Profession Entertainer & Dancer\b0  Entertainers/Dancers: Modifying /watch and /listen so that you can perform these actions while sitting on the ground\line\line\b Profession: Image Designer\b0  Fully decorated all the Image Designer salons Added music inside the Image Design salons Master ID timer changes (a master outside the Image Design salon gets 1/2 time, a master inside the Image Design salon has no time required)\line\line\b Profession: Jedi\b0\line As part of the Jedi revamp, Jedi will find that they will have to deconstruct their lightsabers via a new radial menu option. Jedi will be able to use their crystals and pearls as they will be reclaimed using the new system. Please make sure you have enough free inventory space before attempting to deconstruct any lightsaber. New lightsabers are a weapon that is also a slotted container based on a player's level. The only items a Jedi may place in the lightsaber is 1 Color Crystal and 1-4 (based on lightsaber type) ?tuned? Force Crystals or ?tuned? Krayt Pearls. The stats of the basic lightsaber will remain at its crafted values, however stats will go up and down based on the values of the crystals placed within. The lightsaber?s blade color will be determined by the ?Color Crystal?. Lightsaber's without a color crystal cannot be used. Based on its generation, lightsaber's will gain slight stat bonuses along with more container slots to put crystals in. There are 4 styles available to each lightsaber skill line now.\line\line A Jedi will now be required to ?Tune? the crystal or pearl he/she wishes to use. A Jedi will use the Force to tune the crystal to their body. Once tuned, the crystals and pearls will only fit within lightsabers crafted by that Jedi. Jedi may only use lightsabers that they have crafted. Lightsabers, tuned crystals, and pearls will all be tradable to others. There will be a description on the crystal and pearl after it has been tuned to the player who tuned and the stats will be visible at the time. Lightsabers may not be sliced. All crystals and pearls must be tuned. A lightsaber must have 1 color crystal in it to power on. All crystals must be in the lightsaber prior to equipping it as once equipped the lightsaber inventory cannot be altered. A player must unequip a lightsaber if they wish to change the setup of their crystals. Lightsabers will no longer decay; now, crystals and pearls decay based on damage. Once the condition of a crystal or pearl reaches 1 or lower it must be replaced. The crystal/pearl?s text will change to red when it is no longer usable.\line These changes will affect players who have already unlocked their Force Sensitive (FS) slots. Players who have not unlocked their FS slot may continue to master professions for credit, but no new players will become Jedi until \b Publish 10, The Jedi Trials\b0 . Players may still unlock their slot, but it will not be active until Publish 10.\line\line Reworked Force Healing line. Heals now cost a proportionate amount of force cost based on the amount they heal. Heals are no longer for a random amount, but have a fixed maximum for each ability. Different abilities have different force cost efficiencies. Fixed a bug where 2 dueling dark Jedi get an imperial TEF Fixed a memory leak that would occur every time a new lightsaber was turned on or thrown Jedi don't regenerate force power while incapacitated Fixed a bug where all thrown lightsabers emitted a red swoosh visual. Swooshes for thrown lightsabers now match the color of the blade Added Entertainer healing skill mods to Force Sensitive Healing skills\line\line\b Profession: Merchant\b0  Fixed a problem with the Merchant entry fee window incorrectly applying entry fee\line\line\b Profession: Smuggler\b0  You will no longer be able to slice an item by using a tool in a crate. You will have to remove it from the crate first.\line\line\b Profession: Tailor\b0  Fixed missing color option on Bandoliers (Now both color options are available)\line\line\b Technical Support\b0  Fixed problem where the optional hardware information reports would sometimes be sent with an incorrect station id Added warning for known bad older card/driver combination Setup - Win 98 no longer incorrectly reports CPU is too slow Setup screen - automatic settings for low-memory conditions\line\line\b Theme Parks / Missions / Quests\b0  Reintroduced the ?Hero of Tatooine? quest, utilizing brand new static and dynamic content\line\line\b Tutorial / New Player Experience\b0  Made bubble chat greeting from helper droid appear only to owner\line\line\b Vehicles / Mounts\b0  Enter/Exit vehicle changed to toggle Vehicle hit points should now be saved properly when making repairs Fixed vehicle orientation when traveling over water Smoothed ground effect more when driving off of a cliff Players can now use the radial menu, in addition to the previously working slash commands to enter and exit a vehicle while in combat. Removed the option to mount an Incapacitated or Dead Mount\line\line\b World\b0\line Improved terrain LOS and terrain generation Increased occurrence of Stintaril Prowler spawns Loot Kits: Players can now visit Junk Dealers to request a ?loot kit?. These loot kits are containers that will be used to collect miscellaneous items dropped from NPC?s and can be turned into a new reward. Loot kits are free for the asking and one per customer. Players can speak to different junk dealers in order to get new loot kits. Once players decide which loot kit they would like, they may begin collecting the parts. To complete a kit, players will need to gather 10 different items that go with the kit. To see what items the kit requires and which ones have already been gathered, ?examine? the kit. This list also will tell the player what items they still need to loot by use of a ?yes? or ?no? next to each item in that list. Only items that the kit actually requires can be placed inside the kit. When a player gets an item that fits with a kit they own they can instantly drag and drop it into the kit and the kit then will count that item as recovered. Kits will not be tradable between players although all the looted parts will be. Kits can only be placed in your main inventory slot or in the bank. The loot kits examine window gives a basic description of what the kit will make, as will the names of the kits. These items can be kept by the player or sold back to the junk dealer for a 1000 credit reward. \par

\pard\sb100\sa100\b0\fs24 Bounty Hunter Payouts Have Been Adjusted Based on the Level of the Jedi Non-Force ranked Jedi will always be worth at least 25k credits. Force Ranked Jedi will always be worth at least 50k credits \line\line\b Profession: Bounty Hunter\b0  The XP reward has been increased for player Jedi bounty missions. \line\line\b Profession: Jedi\b0  All bounty TEFs should now be cleared correctly upon death from a bounty hunter. Jedi should now be able to completely clear their visibility after 3 weeks if they don't do anything else to increase it during this time. Visibility is gained when drawing your lightsaber or using force powers for each NPC or non allied PC within range. A Jedi must perform a death blow against a bounty hunter to cause the hunter's mission to fail, instead of just incapacitating them. \line\line\b Furniture\b0  All armoires, bookcases, cabinets, and chests can now all hold items. \line\line\b Vendors\b0  Empty Vendors - A vendor is considered empty if it has no items for sale. Empty vendors may not be registered on the planetary map. If a registered vendor becomes empty, he will be removed from the planetary map. If a vendor remains empty for 14 days, the owner will be sent an email warning that the vendor will soon be deleted. If that vendor remains empty for an additional 14 days, the vendor will be deleted. Any items in the vendor's Stock Room and any items offered to that vendor will be deleted with the vendor. Unused Vendors - Vendors who go too long without being used will get deleted from the game. The only events that constitute use are placing a new item for sale on the vendor, or a customer buying an item from the vendor. Checking a vendor's status, paying maintenance, withdrawing sales, having offers placed, or accepting offers are all events that do not reset the Last Used timer. If a vendor goes 14 days without having a new item placed for sale, or an item purchased, then the vendor gets flagged as Unused. If a vendor remains Unused for a 14 days, it becomes in danger of getting deleted. When this happens, the player will be sent an email warning. If the vendor continues to be unused for an additional 14 days, the vendor gets deleted. Any items for sale on the vendor, items in the Stock Room, and offers to that vendor will be deleted with the vendor. Fixed some cases where the number of vendors was being set incorrectly on players. \line\line\b Force Sensitive\b0  Added a check on login to restore the force sensitive title skill to a player that is eligible to enter Aurilia. \line\line\b FS Quests\b0  Updated the code in the medic quest puzzle for phase 1 to fix an unlocking problem Completing the extra patrols in FS Quest Combat 1 should now give the reward item even if you have a full inventory. Tweaked the messaging of the shield destruction in the FS counterstrike quest in order to make it clearer. Crafting Phase 1 Quest: You may only calibrate components that you craft. \line\line\b Nym's Themepark\b0  Jinkins and Kole should no longer require players to drop items on them; instead they can just talk to the NPC \line\line\b Misc\b0  You can no longer revoke the force sensitive title skill as a non-Jedi. (Jedi's already could not revoke this). \line\par

{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Fixed pet duping issue \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}We changed the way group payouts for missions are calculated. When a mission is generated, the reward payout per member is calculated based on the current size of the group. If the group shrinks in size or group members are too far away to receive payout, those that do get paid receive the original per member reward. For example, if 3 players take a mission that pays 12k credits, each player will receive a maximum of 4k credits when the mission is completed. They receive 0 if they are out of range, and less if more people are added to the group to complete the mission \par

You MUST explicitly cast a vote in order to be counted. Abstentions no longer count as votes for the incumbent.\par

\pard\sb100\sa100\b New Droid User Interface\b0  \par
Here's how to use the droid programming UI (flight commands UI) \par
\pard\fi-360\li720\sb100\sa100\tx720 Get a droid, either an astromech or a flight computer. \par
Get programmed chips (optional). If you have un-programmed chips, you can use the radial menu program the chip with any command your character "knows". You can also buy chips with commands you don't know. \par
Select the "Program Droid" command from the radial on the droid. \par
Once the UI appears. All commands you know (from skills) and chips you have (crafted or purchased) are on the left side of the window. All commands IN (active) the droid are on the right side. You can move commands back and forth to program the droid. The volume bar on the right shows how much room you have left. Putting chips in a droid (as opposed to commands you know) destroys the chip when the command is entered. This is so you can get "one-shot" programming of commands you don't know. Each faction gets different commands, so they can trade back and forth. \par
Press "Commit" to make the change to the droid. \par
When you are ready to load your droid or flight computer onto your ship, all you have to do is access a starship terminal and go to the "Manage Components" screen. On the left hand side, select the "Droid/Flight Computer" option and "load" it into your ship. You can now access your droid or flight computer in space by pressing CTRL-A while in space.\par
\pard\sb100\sa100\b Announcement on Engine Component Rebalance\b0\par
The top speed of the Mandal Motors 'Inferno' engine (granted as a quest reward) was reduced from 92 to approximately 79 to achieve better game balance. The certification level required for the 'Inferno' is too low to warrant such a high speed. Please note that engines of this speed (90+) and greater can still be looted and manufactured, but with high enough certification levels as to keep the game balanced. Existing 92 speed "reward" engines will not be affected, but will decay with damage as any other component would. \par
