vBulletin Integration Documentation

In order to integrate with vBulletin we need to interconnect the User Database on the Server
with the database on vBulletin.

In order to do so several steps are required.

A) Verify passwords on vBulletin database to the user database on the Emulator Database.

	vBulletin stores passwords as an MD5 Hash.
	The process vBulletin uses is the following.
	
	1- Receive clear unencrypted password from the user at login.
	2- Retrieve the 'salt' valu from the vBulletin user table.
	3- Hash the password as an MD5 string.
	4- Concatenate the MD5'd password with the 'salt' value and MD5 it again.
	5- Compare the password stored in vBulletin with the newly hashed password.
	
	Notes: The 'salt' value is determined by vBulletin at time of the account being created.
		all passwords will be encrypted using this 'salt' value.
	
	The query commands to store our MD5'd password is the following.

	SELECT md5(CONCAT(md5('{clear password}') , '{salt}'));

	The 'salt' value is in the user table of the vBulletin site.
	The table is users, but this can be prefixed with a chosen value at the intall time of the vBulletin Software.
	
	 
The way we will integrate is the follwoing.

The System will have a table called `loginintegration`
This table will contain by default one record with a login type of 0 and all other fields set to null.

Login type 0 is internal user authentication and will make the system work just as it alsways has till today.

Login type 1 will be for vBulletin. When type is set to 1 all fields will be populated with data as follows:
	
	`logintype` = 1
	`tableprefix` varchar(45) 	= This will be the Table Prefix chosen at the time of installation of the vBulletin CMS Software.
	`tablename` varchar(45) 	= This will be the name of the table containing the user database in vBulletin.
	`usernamefield` varchar(45) 	= This will be the name of the column containing the user name.
	`passwordfield` varchar(45) 	= This is the name of the password column containing the password.
	`keyfield` varchar(45) 		= This is the name of the column containing the 'salt' value for the vBulletin user.
	`encryptiontype` int(10) 	= This will be set to 1, this means MD5 Checksum.
	`hostname` varchar(45) 		= This is the host name for the vBulletin MySQL Database Server.
	`schema` varchar(45) 		= This is the name of the database or schema that contains the vBulleting Database to be accessed. 
	`username` varchar(45) 		= This is the MySQL user name used to login to MySQL to access the Database.
	`password` varchar(45) 		= This is the MySQL password to access the MySQL Database.
	`port` int(10) 			= This is the MySQL Database port to be used when connecting to the MySQL Database.
	`devusergroupid` int(10) 	= This defines what group in the vBulletin Server makes a user a Developer.
	`csrusergroupid` int(10) 	= This defines what group in the vBulletin Server makes a user a CSR or Game Dev. 
	`devcsrgroupid` int(10) 	= This defines what group in the vBulletin Server makes a user be banned. 

Additional Login Types are reserved for future use.

Turning the Login Type on the loginintegration table to 0 disables the feature and allows for all accounts stored locally to login.
If is recommended that when vBLink is active, the server has automatic account registration off.
